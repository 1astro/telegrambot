# telegrambot
This is my first Telegram bot, so it's simple. It's also the first of many projects for my portfolio.

I used Botfather to create the bot and created a few commands for a pizzeria bot example. The structure is simple, as the data is stored in files. Although I could have used platforms to store the data, I chose not to use them since this is a simple example.
